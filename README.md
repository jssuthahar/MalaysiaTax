# Malaysia Tax Calculator (Flutter Web)

A **user-friendly Flutter web app** to estimate Malaysia income tax for residents and foreigners. The app allows users to input their salary, arrival date (for foreigners), and calculates monthly and yearly taxes. It also provides a preview of Malaysian tax brackets and non-resident flat tax rates.
